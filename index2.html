						<p>My Name is Alec Lacsamana.  I spent a lot of time in coffee shops — studying, hanging out, meeting new friends. There was one coffee shop on the second floor of Video Hits Plus that good food, a great atmosphere to study, a big screen for watching movies and even some games to help us de-stress before a big midterm. It became a networking hub for a number of us, as we spent time planning the night’s events, which often included grabbing a beer at Bilbo’s.

						<p>Starting a coffee business is not for the faint of heart. It will bring blood, sweat and tears (plus, a lot of caffeine).

Yet, there’s still something that makes the pursuit worthwhile despite being strapped for cash, overworked and underpaid, running on a un-human amount of sleep, and grappling with the constant uncertainty of your decision to start something of your own.</p>
